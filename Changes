Revision history for WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::JavaScript and ::DOM

0.001   24 November, 2007
        First CPAN release
        • The JavaScript plugin has been completely restructured. It
          now supports multiple backends.
        • It now allows one to provide an initialisation function that
          is run whenever a JavaScript environment is created, as well
          as custom alert, confirm and prompt functions.
        • Allows binding of custom Perl classes via 'bind_classes'.
        • The DOM plugin’s callback routines  for  fetching  the  page
          content as HTML or text now check to see whether the page is
          HTML first.
        • The DOM plugin now overrides extract_forms.
        • Started work on event-handling.
        • A few other minor things
