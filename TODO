finish adding mech callback routines (follow_link, back, forward, get_uri)
write a complete test suite
finish adding browser-only js features (navigator, window properties/methods and whatever else)
check recursive frames
multiple windows
revisit the event handler scope chain; make sure it has everything it's supposed to; document it
add support for HTML::DOM’s utf-16 methods.
have a look at the HTML 5 spec which is supposed to have something about the Window object

Miscellaneous problems:

The JE back end’s bind_class method chokes if there is a superclass without
a corresponding Perl class:

  CSS::DOM::Rule => CSSUnknownRule,
  CSSUnknownRule => { _isa => 'CSSRule' },
  CSSRule        => { ... },

The solution in this case was to fix CSS::DOM before releasing 0.03, but
this could potential bite anyone trying to bind his own classes.
