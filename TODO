Hmmm, this list seems to be getting longer, rather than shorter.

finish adding mech callback routines
write tests
finish adding browser-only js features (i.e., non-DOM stuff like navigator, window properties/methods and whatever else)
frames
windows
figure out a way to make AbstractViews work (window == window.document.defaultView)
revisit the event handler scope chain; make sure it has everything it's supposed to; document it
add support for HTML::DOM’s utf-16 methods.
javascript: URIs
have a look at the HTML 5 spec which is supposed to have something about the Window object
window.onload etc.
whatever else I've forgotten


----------------------------

Miscellaneous problems:

The JE back end’s bind_class method chokes if there is a superclass without
a corresponding Perl class:

  CSS::DOM::Rule => CSSUnknownRule,
  CSSUnknownRule => { _isa => 'CSSRule' },
  CSSRule        => { ... },

The solution in this case was to fix CSS::DOM before releasing 0.03, but
this could potential bite anyone trying to bind his own classes.
