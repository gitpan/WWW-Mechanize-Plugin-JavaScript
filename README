WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::JavaScript and ::DOM, version 0.004 (alpha)

Plugins for WWW::Mechanize that provide HTML DOM and Java-
Script support.

This set of modules is at a very early stage. Only a few features have
been implemented so far. Whether it will work for a particular case is
hard to say. Try it and see. (And patches are always welcome.)


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

The location object now stringifies to its href property instead of
[object Location].

the cpan script:
