WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::JavaScript and ::DOM, version 0.005 (alpha)

Plugins for WWW::Mechanize that provide HTML DOM and Java-
Script support.

This set of modules is at a very early stage. Only a few features have
been implemented so far. Whether it will work for a particular case is
hard to say. Try it and see. (And patches are always welcome.)


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

Four new features (see the Changes file for more detail):
• New scripts_enabled method (DOM plugin) for enabling/disa-
  bling scripts.
• Support for javascript: URLs
• The window object has been disentangled from the JavaScript plugin
  and moved to the DOM plugin.  It is now accessible  via  the  ‘win-
  dow’ method. This has allowed the fourth feature:
• The window object now inherits from HTML::DOM::EventTarget, which
  provides addEventListener, etc.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::JavaScript"
