WWW-Mechanize-Plugin-JavaScript-0.005a (alpha)

Plugins for WWW::Mechanize that provide HTML DOM and Java-
Script support.

This distribution contains:
• WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::DOM            0.006
• WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::JavaScript     0.005
• WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::JavaScript::JE 0.005

This set of modules is at a very early stage. Only a few features have
been implemented so far. Whether it will work for a particular case is
hard to say. Try it and see. (And patches are always welcome.)


RECENT CHANGES

0.005a
------
Two bug fixes:
• The alert, confirm and prompt options to the JavaScript plugin,
  which were broken in the previous release, work again.
• Properties and methods that are supposed to return DOMStrings can
  now return  null.  They used to  return  the  string  ‘undefined’.

0.005
-----
Four new features (see the Changes file for more detail):
• New scripts_enabled method (DOM plugin) for enabling/disa-
  bling scripts.
• Support for javascript: URLs
• The window object has been disentangled from the JavaScript plugin
  and moved to the DOM plugin.  It is now accessible  via  the  ‘win-
  dow’ method. This has allowed the fourth feature:
• The window object now inherits from HTML::DOM::EventTarget, which
  provides addEventListener, etc.
