RECENT CHANGES

(See the Changes file for the long version.)

0.006
-----
• Support for (i)frames
• The window object is now part of the event dispatch chain.
• You can now run JS code without an HTML document.
• When a link in the DOM is clicked (via trigger_event or the click
  method), it now goes to another page.
• Mech’s link- and image-related methods now extract info
  from the DOM.
• Scripts are properly decoded and are no longer always treated
  as Latin 1.
• The DOM tree’s charset attribute is now set.
• The scripts_enabled method now disables event handlers as well as
  <script>s.
• You can now specify custom functions for alert, etc., via the JS
  plugin even after the JS environment has been created.
• !doctype declarations are no longer dropped from the HTML returned
  by Mech’s ‘content’ method.
• The document object now has its location object set. (Thanks to
  David Williams for spotting this.)

0.005a
------
Two bug fixes:
• The alert, confirm and prompt options to the JavaScript plugin,
  which were broken in the previous release, work again.
• Properties and methods that are supposed to return DOMStrings can
  now return  null.  They used to  return  the  string  ‘undefined’.

0.005
-----
Four new features (see the Changes file for more detail):
• New scripts_enabled method (DOM plugin) for enabling/disa-
  bling scripts.
• Support for javascript: URLs
• The window object has been disentangled from the JavaScript plugin
  and moved to the DOM plugin.  It is now accessible  via  the  ‘win-
  dow’ method. This has allowed the fourth feature:
• The window object now inherits from HTML::DOM::EventTarget, which
  provides addEventListener, etc.
